## Summary

A simple mod that keeps many containers from breaking when they are looted; similar to how things were before A21.

## Features

Prevent `auto-destroy` functionality for all loot containers ***except for the following***:

Loot Container Name | Reason for Exclusion
--- | ---
`playerBackpack` | dropped backpacks are entities and should be destroyed once emptied
`airDrop` | air drops are entities and should be destroyed once emptied
`%buried%` / `%Buried%` | any container with the key word `buried` also configured to disappear on loot should be allowed to do so (causes bugs otherwise)
`questRewardSkillMagazines` | these quest rewards are meant to be looted only once
`%infested%` | special containers rewarded to players who complete infested quests should only be looted once
`%twitch%` | any twitch-related or twitch-spawned containers shouldn't remain once looted

> NOTE: Bags dropped by zombies are not managed by the `destroy_on_close`; some other part of the code handles their cleanup and they will continue to function as they always have.
